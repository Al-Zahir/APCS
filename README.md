Final project for AP Computer Science A

This project will be made in eclipse and will require an Android device. It is a
chess game that will be used for multiplayer and single player games. The 
multiplayer game will be played on the same device. The single player game will
have a somewhat smart AI that will attempt to pick its best move.
